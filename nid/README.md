# Network-based Intrusion Detection (NID)

This directory contains resources for setting up and configuring Network-based Intrusion Detection (NID) systems. NID systems monitor network traffic in real-time to detect and respond to suspicious activities or potential security breaches.

## Overview

Network-based Intrusion Detection (NID) systems analyze network packets, protocols, and traffic patterns to identify known threats or anomalies indicative of unauthorized access, malware infections, or other malicious activities. This directory provides scripts, rules/signatures, and documentation to help you deploy and manage NID systems in your environment.

## Contents

- **scripts/**: Directory containing scripts for NID functionality, such as capturing network traffic and analyzing network packets.
- **rules/**: Directory containing rules or signatures used by NID systems for signature-based detection, including Snort rules, Suricata YAML rules, or rules in other supported formats.
- **documentation/**: Directory containing documentation for setting up, configuring, and using NID systems. Includes installation guides, configuration tutorials, and troubleshooting tips.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. **Explore the `scripts/` directory**: Review the scripts available for NID functionality, such as capturing and analyzing network traffic. Modify or customize the scripts as needed for your environment.
3. **Review the `rules/` directory**: Examine the rules or signatures provided for signature-based detection. Adjust the rules to suit your specific threat detection requirements.
4. **Consult the `documentation/` directory**: Refer to the documentation for detailed setup instructions, configuration guides, and usage tips for deploying and managing NID systems.
